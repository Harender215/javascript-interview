# Implement Custom String Tokenizer

## Problem Statement

- Implement a custom functionality of `tokenizer()` which
processes your input string (basically a math expression in
our case) into multiple tokens and gets those individual
tokens.

- As for our problem statement, we need to tokenize math
expressions.
For example, letâ€™s say we have a math expression `10 + 20`
Where each of these 10, +, 20 happens to be your tokens
omitting the whitespaces.
